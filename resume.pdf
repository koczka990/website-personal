RESUME PLACEHOLDER

This is a placeholder file for Vencel DÃ¡vid Koczka's resume.

To replace this with your actual resume:

1. Create a PDF version of your resume
2. Name it "resume.pdf"
3. Replace this file with your PDF resume
4. The download link in the hero section will automatically work

The resume should include:
- Contact information
- Professional summary
- Education (MSc Data Science, BSc Computer Science Engineering)
- Work experience (Hypertype, Ericsson, EPIC InnoLabs, KIBU)
- Skills (LLM applications, RAG pipelines, Python, C#, etc.)
- Projects and achievements

Make sure the PDF is optimized for web viewing and is not too large (preferably under 2MB) for faster downloads.
